#.NET Micro Framework Interpreter  

Welcome to the .NET Micro Framework interpreter GitHub repository. (Master Branch)

The Microsoft® .NET Micro Framework combines the reliability and efficiency of managed code with the premier development tools of Microsoft Visual Studio® to deliver exceptional productivity for developing embedded applications on small devices. The Microsoft .NET Micro Framework SDK supports development of code, including device I/O, in the C# language using a subset of the .NET libraries, and is fully integrated with the Microsoft Visual Studio® development environment. The .NET Micro Framework class library supports all major namespaces and types from the desktop framework, managed drivers support, Remote Firmware Updates and Cryptographic functions for Secure Devices. This GitHub project allows building the full SDK and device Firmware images including the lwIP open source TCP/IP stack and the OpenSSL distribution.

##Master Branch
The Master branch contains released source code that is updated when major milestones are released, including Beta builds. Active development is done in the [dev](https://github.com/NETMF/netmf-interpreter/tree/dev) branch. Thus the Master is considered fairly stable and never receives commits directly. (e.g. Any pull requests targeting the Master branch will be rejected automatically. All contributions should appear as a pull request to the dev branch) 

### Wiki Docs
Information on building the framework and internal development guides will appear on the [wiki](https://github.com/NETMF/netmf-interpreter/wiki). If you have Wiki content that is relevant to the NETMF development community or code that you would like to [contribute](https://github.com/NETMF/netmf-interpreter/wiki/Contributing) feel free to join in and participate in the future of the .NET Micro Framework!
