Welcome to the .NET Micro Framework interpreter GitHub repository. 

The Microsoft® .NET Micro Framework combines the reliability and efficiency of managed code with the premier development tools of Microsoft Visual Studio® to deliver exceptional productivity for developing embedded applications on small devices. The Microsoft .NET Micro Framework SDK supports development of code, including device I/O, in the C# language using a subset of the .NET libraries, and is fully integrated with the Microsoft Visual Studio® development environment. The .NET Micro Framework class library supports all major namespaces and types from the desktop framework, managed drivers support, Remote Firmware Updates and Cryptographic functions for Secure Devices. This GitHub project allows building the full SDK and device Firmware images including the lwIP open source TCP/IP stack and the OpenSSL distribution.
